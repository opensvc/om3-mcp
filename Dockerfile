# The image of the OpenSVC daemon MCP: the binary alone on alpine, run as
# opensvc-mcp, uid 994 and gid 982, the IDs the files and the sockets of the
# service are given, the same on every node.
# The base images are pinned by digest: a tag moved in the registry does not
# change a release. The Go of the build is the toolchain line of go.mod, which
# CI tests and checks for vulnerabilities with: change both together. It is
# newer than the go line, the language version, for the fixes of the standard
# library the binary carries, Go 1.25 getting no more of them.
